In this post, I will try to tell you who I am and what is this blog about. This will be the first one of - I hope - many 
posts about a couple of technological topics. Bear in mind that this is a side project and I will create more post when 
I had enough time. The main goal is enjoy and learn together!

First of all, I would like to apologize for all the mistakes and misspellings I am sure I am going to make. English is 
not my mother tongue, but I will try to do my best. If someone finds out something wrong, I will be very thankful to 
get that feedback. All of you may contact me through my social networks or make a pull request. With your help, 
it will be easier to improve and learn together.

## Why this blog?

In one hand, I really appreciate all the free good quality content about any topic that it is available on the web. 
I learn a lot everyday due this posts, tutorials and free information. I have been thinking about doing this blog for a 
long time and also it is a way to contribute with the open community.

On the other hand, this is a way of forcing myself to improve the background I have. I believe that there is no better 
way to upgrade the knowledge that one has to explain something you think you know.

>So, Turn it on!!

## What is the goal?

I would like to write quite short post about specific topics. The main idea is they should be easily understandable, 
just as I like to be taught. So, I will apply the [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com) approach. 
When I may touch any complex or long topic, I will probably split the whole item into some small parts: more simple to 
write and to eat!

So, bellow I show you some of the main subjects I will take to write the posts. Some of them will related to things 
I learnt on professional and side projects and other will be issues I picked up on my own.

* Data science
* Machine Learning
* Big Data
* Crypto world
* Music
* Never know...

## Stay tuned!

>Music is very important in my life. So I will share with you an small music piece with every post! 
Today I recommend you "The birth of the Blues" with the great "Rat Pack"!
